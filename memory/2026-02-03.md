## Ops Dashboard
- Added **autostart via launchd** (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.ops-dashboard.plist`) — starts on login, KeepAlive enabled
- Implemented **drag/drop + edit** for the kanban board:
  - Click "+" to add card
  - Click card to edit title/detail (or delete)
  - Drag cards between columns (Now / Next / Blocked / Done / Thinking)
  - Persists to `dashboard/data/board.json`
- Dashboard still running at http://192.168.1.2:3030 (user: hamza, pass: change-me-now)

## Google Antigravity Auth
- Enabled plugin: `openclaw plugins enable google-antigravity-auth`
- Successfully completed OAuth flow for `hamza3mahmood@gmail.com`
- **Default model now set to:** `google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-5-thinking`
- Auth profile stored: `google-antigravity:hamza3mahmood@gmail.com`

## OpenClaw CLI
- Discovered CLI path: `~/.nvm/versions/node/v24.13.0/bin/openclaw`
- Note: `openclaw` not on PATH by default; need full path or add to PATH

## Notes
- OAuth callback flow can be flaky (timeout issues); retry with browser ready works
