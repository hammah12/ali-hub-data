## Config Fix: Gateway Bind Address
- Hamza asked about Tailscale binding issues in Docker/Zeabur environments
- **Problem**: `gateway.bind` was set to `"loopback"` (127.0.0.1)
  - In containerized environments, services must bind to `0.0.0.0` for external access
  - Loopback binding causes ingress/health-check failures
- **Fix applied**: Changed `gateway.bind` from `"loopback"` to `"any"` in `/Users/hamzamahmood/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Gateway restarted via SIGUSR1 at ~11:53 CST
- Note: `gateway.config.patch` tool returned "invalid config" errors; used direct file edit instead
